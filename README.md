# Chameleon_SoC_with-SST26VF080A-flash-
This project uses a python script to establish a communication between the SST26VF080A flash and the open Source [chameleon SoC](https://github.com/shalan/Chameleon_SoC) in two modes. 
First in the SPI mode to program the flash and second in the QUAD SPI mode to read the instruction from the flash.

## Flash Writer and UART master integration to the Chameleon SoC FROM [here](https://github.com/nabadawy/AMEN2S-SoC):
To establish a communication between the SoC and to the flash the Chameleon SoC architecture was updated as follow:

## Program the flash (SPI mode): 
To program the flash; ARTIX-7 FPGA, USB TTL  was used with the following connections:

After connecting all wires, the python script can be used to program the flash in the SPI mode with the mem file ( mem file can be generated by [RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain)). 
To be able to program the flash, you should first unlock memory locations to be able to write to them. Unlocking those locations can be done be first writing the BP0, BP1, and BP2 to zero in the Status register.
